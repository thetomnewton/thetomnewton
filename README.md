### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer specialising in building web apps with Laravel, Vue and Tailwind.

I've been the lead developer at @CashCalc since 2013. We developed it from an in-house spreadsheet into the market leader of Cashflow Modelling tools in the UK financial advice industry.

I'm also working on Swft Scheduling in my spare time, which is a really simple and customisable way for people to schedule meetings and appointments with each other.

I'm a self-taught programmer who is constantly trying to learn and improve, and with my articles I hope to give something back to the community I've learned so much from.
