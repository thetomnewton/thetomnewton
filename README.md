### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer specialising in building web applications.

I was the lead developer / technical lead at @CashCalc for over 9 years. We developed it from an in-house spreadsheet into the market leader of Cashflow Modelling tools in the UK financial advice industry.

I'm also working on [Pavrel](https://www.pavrel.com), an app for software teams to track and collaborate on ideas.

Give me a follow on Twitter to keep up with what I'm working on: [@tomjnewton](https://twitter.com/tomjnewton)
