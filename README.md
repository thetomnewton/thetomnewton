### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer specialising in building web apps with Laravel, Vue and Tailwind.

I've been the lead developer at @CashCalc since 2013. We developed it from an in-house spreadsheet into the market leader of Cashflow Modelling tools in the UK financial advice industry.

I'm a self-taught programmer who is constantly trying to learn and improve.

Give me a follow on Twitter to keep up with what I'm working on: [@tomjnewton](https://twitter.com/tomjnewton)
