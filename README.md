### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer specialising in building web applications.

I was a founding engineer at a UK fintech SaaS where I worked for almost 10 years. We developed it from an in-house spreadsheet into a market leading tool in the UK financial advice industry, and was eventually acquired in 2021.

Some of my favourite tools and libraries are TypeScript, Vue.js, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Laravel, AWS, and Docker.

I have worked as a lead developer, technical lead, lead frontend developer, and CTO in my previous roles.
